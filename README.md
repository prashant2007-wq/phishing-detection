## 🏁 Overview

This phishing detection system allows users to input any URL and determines whether it is potentially a phishing site. The detection logic uses key characteristics of URLs — such as URL length, suspicious tokens, redirection, IP usage, and more — and classifies them using a trained machine learning model or rules.

The frontend is built with a modern JS framework (e.g., Vite + React) for a smooth user experience, while the backend handles detection logic and model inference.
